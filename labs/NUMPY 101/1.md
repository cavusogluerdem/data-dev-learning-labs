### PYTHON - AN INTRODUCTION ###

What is Python?
Python is a general purpose programming language that is often applied in scripting roles. So, Python is programming language as well as scripting language and is also called as Interpreted language. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 

**Why do people use Python?**

* Python is object-oriented:

Structure supports concepts such as polymorphism, operation overloading, and multiple inheritance.
   
* Indentation:

Indentation is one of the greatest features in Python. 
   
* Free (open source):

Downloading and installing Python is free and easy
Source code is easily accessible
   
* Powerful:

Dynamic typing
-Built-in types and tools
-Library utilities
-Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, SciPy)
-Automatic memory management
   
* Portable:

Python runs virtually on every major platform used today

* Mixable:

Python can be linked to components written in other languages easily

* Easy to use:

No intermediate compile and link steps as in C/ C++
	
* Easy to learn:

Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp


**Python Evolution Overview**

* Invented in the Netherlands, early 90s by Guido van Rossum

* Guido Van Rossum was fan of  ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, a famous TV show in Netherlands and Python was named 
  after Monty Python
  
* Open sourced from the beginning.

### NUMPY - AN INTRODUCTION ###

NumPy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.

Besides Python, there are a number of open source libraries generally used to facilitate practical machine learning. In general, these are the main so-called scientific Python libraries we put to use when performing elementary machine learning tasks:

NumPy - Mainly useful for its N-dimensional array objects
SciPy - A collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python
Pandas - Python data analysis library, including structures such as dataframes
Matplotlib - Plotting library which produces publication quality figures

**Why do people use NumPy?**

* A powerful N-dimensional array object
* Sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
* Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
* Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
* Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. 
* Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of 	 
  databases.

### **Step 2 : Workspace Page**

On click of Start button, you will be navigated to a workspace page where all the components - IDE, Tools and Microservices required to execute the program are made available. Please refer the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/HADOOP%20101%20WITH%20BASIC%20TERMINAL%20HANDS-ON%20EXERCISES/assets/images/NumPy2.jpeg?raw=true)

### **Step 3 : Start Service in Workspace**

Points to Note:

* Start the Zeppelin service.Please refer screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/BASIC%20DATA%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20APACHE%20ZEPPELIN/assets/images/NumPy6.jpeg?raw=true)

* The Zeppelin interactive,development and visualisation environment is now ready for use. The pre-created notebook has all the codes required for executing this learning lab. Each of the code shown below needs to be executed sequentially. 

### **Step 6 : Execute Python Code**

The following codes are provided in Zeppelin to understand the usage of NumPy :

1) Basic Operations:

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
import numpy as np

a = np.array( [[10,20,30,40,50], [20, 30, 40, 50, 60]] )
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

#Arithmetic operators on arrays are applied elementwise
c = a-b
print(c)
c.shape
c.ndim
c.size
```
2) Universal Functions

The code is as follows:

```json
%python

A = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)
print(A)
# sum of each column
A.sum(axis=0)
# min of each row
A.min(axis=1)
# cumulative sum along each row
A.cumsum(axis=1)

np.exp(A)
np.sqrt(A)
```
3) Stacking together different arrays :

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
a = np.floor(20*np.random.random((2,2)))
print(a)
b = np.floor(20*np.random.random((2,2)))
print(b)
np.hstack((a,b))
np.vstack((a,b))
```
4) Indexing with Arrays of Indices and Boolean Arrays

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3,5)
print(a)
# indices for the first dim of a
i = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 2]])
# indices for the second dim
j = np.array([[2, 0], [3, 1]])
a[i,j]

# first dim selection
b1 = np.array([False,True,True])
# selecting rows
a[b1,:] 

# second dim selection
b2 = np.array([True,False,True,False, False])
# selecting columns
a[:,b2]
```
5) Linear Algebra

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
A = np.arange(4).reshape(2,2)
print(A)
A.transpose()
np.linalg.inv(A)

B = np.array( [[2,1], [3,4]] )
# elementwise product
A*B
# matrix product
A.dot(B)
```

Execute the code by clicking on the "Ready" icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:.
