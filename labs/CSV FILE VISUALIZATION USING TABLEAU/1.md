# <center>CSV FILE VISUALIZATION USING TABLEAU</center>

<b>Executed on</b>: Hadoop Big Data Platform

<b>Visualization tool used</b>: Tableau


## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding on how to visualise a CSV(Comma Seperated Values) file using Tableau.We will be using DevNet Data Technology Learning Platform referred as "DTLP" during the course.


## PRE-REQUISITES

1. Install Chrome Browser.

2. Input file in CSV (Comma Seperated Values) format<br>

   a. The file must have a header line with names for each data column.<br>

   b. The file size should be smaller than 50 MB.<br>

3. Obtain access to Data Technology Learning Platform -
                                                          Refer: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/WORD%20COUNT%20USING%20SCALA%20WITH%20APACHE%20SPARK/HowToAccessDTLP.md


## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

1. To get familiarized with the DTLP (Data Technology Learning Platform).

2. To get familiarized with the ways to get data from a file. 

3. To get familiarized with the ways to use preloaded network data from HDFS platform and analyse the same to check how many UDP(User Datagram Protocol) and ICMP(Internet control message protocol) packages have been received in each second.

3. To get familiarized with data visualization using Tableau.


## TERMINOLOGIES USED


### TABLEAU - AN INTRODUCTION

Tableau is a powerful business intelligence and analytics tool. There are mainly five main products catering to diverse visualization needs for professionals and organizations. They are:

Tableau Desktop: Made for individual use
Tableau Server: Collaboration for any organization
Tableau Online: Business Intelligence in the Cloud
Tableau Reader: Let you read files saved in Tableau Desktop.
Tableau Public: For journalists or anyone to publish interactive data online.

Tableau Desktop is a data visualization application that lets you analyze virtually any type of structured data and produce highly interactive, beautiful graphs, dashboards, and reports. You can connect to virtually any data source from spreadsheets to data warehouses and display information in multiple graphic perspectives.

### <b>Step 3 : Start Service in Workspace</b>

Points to Note:

* Start the Tableau(service in visualize column). Please refer screenshot below:

* If the task is in stopped status then click on it to start again. 

### <b>Step 4 : Launch Tableau</b>

Click on launch button and user will be navigated to Tableau home page.

Points to note:

The pop-up may be blocked in browser configuration. Please refer the screenshot below:

Click on the pop up blocker icon and select <b>Always allow pop-up from http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx </b> and click on <b>Done</b> button.) </br>

### <b>Step 5 : Explore Tableau</b>

User can now explore the data with drag and drop operations and create reports.

For example, if you want to create a report to view how many “UDP” and “ICMP” packages are received each minute, please follow the steps given below:

1. Right click on “receive_time” field.
2. Click “Create calculated field …”
3. Create a new field named “receive_time_new”.Apply DATETIME operator to “receive_time” field as shown below:

![Creating a new field](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/vizualize-csv-tableau/assets/images/receive_time_new_field.png?raw=true)


4. Drag "Number of Records" from "Measures" to "Columns"
5. Drag "protocol" field from "Dimensions" to "Rows"
6. Click the "TCP" tag, and then click "Exclude".

![Excluding TCP](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/CSV%20FILE%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20TABLEAU/assets/images/MessureSelection11.PNG?raw=true)

7. Drag “receive_time_new” from Dimensions to Rows.
8. Right click on “YEAR(receive_time_new)” and then select “Minute”,

![Configuring rows](https://github.com/prakdutt/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/vizualize-csv-tableau/assets/images/configure_rows.png?raw=true)

8. Change the "Marks" column type from "Automatic" to "Bar" type. The final report looks as shown in the screenshot below: 
</br>
On selecting "Bar" as <b>Marks</b> type, the final output would be as shown below:
