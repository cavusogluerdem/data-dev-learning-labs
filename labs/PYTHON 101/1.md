## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### HADOOP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

What is Python?
Python is a general purpose programming language that is often applied in scripting roles. So, Python is programming language as well as scripting language and is also called as Interpreted language. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 

**Why do people use Python?**

* Python is object-oriented
Structure supports concepts such as polymorphism, operation overloading, and multiple inheritance.
   
* Indentation 
Indentation is one of the greatest features in Python. 
   
* Free (open source)
Downloading and installing Python is free and easy
Source code is easily accessible
   
* Powerful
Dynamic typing
-Built-in types and tools
-Library utilities
-Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, SciPy)
-Automatic memory management
   
* Portable
Python runs virtually on every major platform used today

* Mixable
Python can be linked to components written in other languages easily

* Easy to use
No intermediate compile and link steps as in C/ C++
	
* Easy to learn
Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp


**Python Evolution Overview**

* Invented in the Netherlands, early 90s by Guido van Rossum

* Guido Van Rossum was fan of  ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, a famous TV show in Netherlands and Python was named 
  after Monty Python
  
* Open sourced from the beginning.

Please follow the steps given below to launch the workspace and execute the program.

### **Step 1 : Select Learning Lab from DLP**

After launching the DLP dashboard page, navigate to learning labs tab. Select the learning lab "Python 101" and click on "Start" button as shown in screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/HADOOP%20101%20WITH%20BASIC%20TERMINAL%20HANDS-ON%20EXERCISES/assets/images/Python1.jpeg?raw=true)

### **Step 2 : Workspace Page**

On click of Start button, you will be navigated to a workspace page where all the components - IDE, Tools and Microservices required to execute the program are made available. Please refer the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lpalamth/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/HADOOP%20101%20WITH%20BASIC%20TERMINAL%20HANDS-ON%20EXERCISES/assets/images/Python2.jpeg?raw=true)

### **Step 3 : Start Service in Workspace**

Points to Note:

* Start the Zeppelin service.Please refer screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/BASIC%20DATA%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20APACHE%20ZEPPELIN/assets/images/Python3.jpeg?raw=true)

* Once started, the colour of the icon changes to green and launch button is enabled.

* If the task is in stopped status then click on it to start again. 

### **Step 4 : Launch Zeppelin**

Click on launch button and user will be navigated to Zeppelin home page.

Points to note:

(The pop-up may be blocked in browser configuration. Click on the red pop up blocker icon and select **Always allow pop-up from http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ** and click on **Done** button.)

### **Step 5 : Select Zeppelin notebook**

* Select pre-created notebook - "Python 101" from home page as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/BASIC%20DATA%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20APACHE%20ZEPPELIN/assets/images/Python6.jpeg?raw=true)

* The Zeppelin interactive,development and visualisation environment is now ready for use. The pre-created notebook has all the codes required for executing this learning lab. Each of the code shown below needs to be executed sequentially. 

### **Step 6 : Execute Python Code**

The following codes are provided in Zeppelin :

1) Print Hello World

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
import sys
print(sys.version)
print('Hello World!')
```
2) If Statement Example

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
age = 5

if age >= 18:
    print('adult')
elif age >= 7:
    print('teenager')
else:
    print('kid')
```
3) For Statement Example

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
sum = 0
for x in range(101):
    sum = sum + x

print(sum)
```
4) Slice Example

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
L = list(range(50))
L[:5]
L[-5:]
L[10:15]
L[:20:3]
L[::10]
```
5) Map/Reduce Example

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
def f(x):
    return x*x

r = map(f, list(range(5)))
m = list(r)
print(m)

from functools import reduce
def add(x, y):
    return x+y

reduce(add, m)
```

Execute the code by clicking on the "Ready" icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:.
