Hadoop framework includes following four modules:

1. **Hadoop Common:** These are Java libraries and utilities required by other Hadoop modules. These libraries provides filesystem and OS level abstractions and contains the necessary Java files and scripts required to start Hadoop.

2. **Hadoop YARN:** A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.

3. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS™):** A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
4. **Hadoop MapReduce:** A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.

Please Note: 
HDFS – Environment Parameter 
Learning-labs – directory name

**File upload to HDFS from local desktop:**

* Create a file in the local system with the content as hello, hadoop-learning-labs. Please follow the command mentioned below to do so:

```jason
echo “hello, hadoop-learning-labs” >> hadoop-learning-labs.txt
```
