## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### APACHE ZEPPELIN - AN INTRODUCTION

Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. 

Zeppelin enables data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organising, executing, and sharing data code and visualising results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. It brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark. It supports Python and also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown. The various languages are supported via Zeppelin language interpreters. Zeppelin’s notebooks provides interactive snippet-at-time experience to data scientist.

###### Key Features:

1. Web based notebook style editor.

2. Built-in Apache Spark support.

###### Use Cases for Zeppelin :

1. Data Exploration and discovery

2. Data Visualization - Tables,graphs and charts

3. Interactive snippet-at-a-time experience

4. Collaboration and publishing

### TENSORFLOW - AN INTRODUCTION 

TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the tensor. A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions.The flexible architecture of TensorFlow allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. 
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

### **Step 5 : Select Zeppelin notebook**

* Select pre-created notebook - "Tensorflow" from home page as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/BASIC%20DATA%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20APACHE%20ZEPPELIN/assets/images/Tensorflow6.jpeg?raw=true)

* The Zeppelin interactive,development and visualisation environment is now ready for use. The pre-created notebook has all the codes required for executing this learning lab. Each of the code shown below needs to be executed sequentially. 

### **Step 6 : Execute Python Code**

We are using code written in Python for data generation. 

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
import numpy as np                                                     #Import numpy library
x = np.linspace( -np.pi, np.pi , 1000)                                 #Define a numpy array which should be eventually distributed along (-Pi, Pi).
y = np.cos(x)                                                          #Define an array y = cos(x)
print x,y                                                              #Print the cosine signal data
```
Following functions are being done by the Python Code :

1. Import numpy library from Zeppelin UI. 

  *Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with python. It contains very powerful mathematical functions.   In this learning lab, we will make use of functions defined in Numpy to create cosine signal data.
  
2. Numpy array definition that is eventually distributed along (-Pi, Pi). The syntax of numpy.linspace is as given below :
   numpy.linspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, retstep=False, dtype=None)

    For more details, please refer:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html 

3. Array definition : y=cos(x). 

4. Printing all the **cosine** values from array. 

Execute the code by clicking on the "Ready" icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:.

On successful execution of code, you can view the cosine signal data in Zeppelin as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/BASIC%20DATA%20VISUALIZATION%20USING%20APACHE%20ZEPPELIN/assets/images/Tensorflow8.jpeg?raw=true)

### **Step 7 : Plot cosine wave**

In the previous step, we have created the cosine signal data. Now we need to plot the cosine wave.In order to plot the cosine wave, we will use **Matplotlib** which is a python 2D plotting library that produces quality figures in a variety of formats and interactive environments across platforms. 

Below is the python code that will help to draw the Cosine wave from cosine data. 

```json
%python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                                        #Import matplotlib library
import StringIO

plt.plot(x,y)                                                          #Plot the cosine signal in memory

img = StringIO.StringIO()                                              #Create StringIO object which named img
plt.savefig(img, format='svg')                                         #Save the figure in svg format
img.seek(0)                                                            #Get the memory of the figure
print "%html <div style='width:300pt'>" + img.buf + "</div>"           #Show the cosine signal curve
```

Following functions are being done by the Python Code :

i)   Import of Matplotlib, StringIO library in Zeppelin. 
ii)  Plot the cosine wave in memory. 
iii) Creation of StringIO object for reading string buffer data from memory. 
iv)  Creation of an image with cosine data reading from memory in svg format. 
v)   Obtain the starting memory address of the image created in previous step. 
vi)  Display of output as cosine wave in Zeppelin UI.
