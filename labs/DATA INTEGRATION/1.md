### WHAT IS DATA INTEGRATION? - AN INTRODUCTION

"Data Integration" refers to combining data from incompatible sources into meaningful and valuable information.
Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/DataIntegration2.jpeg?raw=true)

We are using two different data sources here:

1. MySQL - RDBMS data source. 

2. Hive - Hadoop data source.

Consider an organization with these two different data sources intends to develop an application or a report. A unified data store is required where data from both the above two data sources can be saved. There should be a unique key or an ID to identify and match the records in each of these data sources. The unified view thus created helps users to get a better understanding of the data, faster decision making, Operational efficiency, Competitive advantage in the market etc.

#### Why is Data Integration Important?

An enterprise application works well when it has all the data available at one place. Data resides in different data sources and in different formats. Accumulating data from all those data sources and making it in a usable format is a challenging task. Data Integration helps to collect and accumulate data from various data sources and present as a single data pool. 

A brief description to why should every enterprise application have a data integration plan:

1)	Makes your data always readily available for your application.
2)	Data Integrity 
3)	Helps to make smarter business decisions by understanding data properly.
4)	Collaboration of data by connecting the near-&-far data-sources.
5)	More data availability for the application.
6)	Reduce data complexity.
7)	Helps to process structured and un-structured data in to the format required by the application.

#### Trends of Data Integration in Modern Era:

Data is the key asset of any enterprise application. Proper availability of data makes the application to run smoothly.  Below are the modern trends of Data Integration operations across the industries:

##### 1.	Growth of complex regulations that surround the use of data:
Data is scattered and distributed in nature. Accumulating those data and use is a challenge in modern data oriented projects. Complexity of regulated data is growing every day at their own pace. Data integration can help to accumulate and normalize data for further use.
##### 2.	Support for Internet of Things (IoT):
Modern industries are focusing on automation by applying Internet of Things (IoT). IoT devices are generating large volume of data every moment. Data Integration platform helps to collect data and make them available to process and develop analytical reports.
##### 3.	Big data trend on the rise: 
Data warehouse concept is being replaced slowly with Hadoop. Old and traditional approach for data collection is not gaining importance anymore. Hadoop and its’s various tools are replacing the concept of traditional data storaget by applying replication and speed processing/execution. Data Integration thus helps to collect and store data to build a modern Hadoop based data warehouse.

### TABLEAU - AN INTRODUCTION

Tableau is a powerful business intelligence and analytics tool. There are mainly five main products catering to diverse visualization needs for professionals and organizations. They are:

Tableau Desktop: Made for individual use
Tableau Server: Collaboration for any organization
Tableau Online: Business Intelligence in the Cloud
Tableau Reader: Let you read files saved in Tableau Desktop.
Tableau Public: For journalists or anyone to publish interactive data online.

Tableau Desktop is a data visualization application that lets you analyze virtually any type of structured data and produce highly interactive, beautiful graphs, dashboards, and reports. You can connect to virtually any data source from spreadsheets to data warehouses and display information in multiple graphic perspectives.

There are primarily 3 different data transformation operations performed on the data.

1.Join 

2.ABS 

3.Sort 

**Join Operation:**

JOIN operation helps to merge data from multiple data sources and extract data based on the common fields. In our use case, the inner join will extract data from mysql and hive databases based on the common field - “ID”. If the ID field matches then the data is extracted and the combined data is displayed in a tabular format.

There are 3 different Join operations supported:

1. Inner Join :

Inner join helps to select records from both the tables(Mysql and Hive tables used as an example here) as long as there is a match between the key fields selected(ID field used in the example shown below) :

Please refer the screenshot below for more details.

2. Full Outer Join :

Full outer join will select all the rows from both the tables(Mysql and Hive tables used as an example here) and displays the combined data in tabular format. It puts NULL in the columns where related records do not exist in the opposite table.

Please refer the screenshot below for more details.

3. Left Join :

Left Join gets all records from the LEFT linked table but if you have selected some columns from the RIGHT table and if there is no related records then those columns will be marked as NULL.

Please refer the screenshot below for more details. 

Configure input:

4. ABS Operation:

ABS stands for Absolute value. ABS function displays any "Integer" field in Absolute format.

Please refer the screenshot below for more details. 

Configure input:

5. Sort Operation:

Sort function is used to display the records of a table selected in sorted order. Sort operation works based on a specific field selected. There are sort orders - Ascending and Descending. Based on your selected field and sort order type, the output is displayed in tabular format.

Sort - Ascending:
