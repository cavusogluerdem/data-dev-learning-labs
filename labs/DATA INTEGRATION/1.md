### WHAT IS DATA INTEGRATION? - AN INTRODUCTION

"Data Integration" refers to combining data from incompatible sources into meaningful and valuable information.
Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/DataIntegration2.jpeg?raw=true)

We are using two different data sources here:
1. Mysql which is a RDBMS data source 
2. Hive which is a Hadoop data source. 

Consider an organization with these two different data sources intends to develop an application or a report. A unified data store is required where data from both the above two data sources can be saved. There should be unique one key parameter for e.g. ID to identify and match the records in each of these data sources.
The unified view created thus helps users to get a better understanding of the data, faster decision making, Operational efficiency, Competitive advantage in the market etc.


### DTLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Technology Learning Platform (DTLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DTLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.

### <b>Step 4: Workspace Page</b>

On click of Start button, user will be navigated to a workspace page where all the components - IDE, Tools and Microservices required to execute the program are available. Please refer the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/edit/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion2.png?raw=true)

### <b>Step 5 : Start Tasks in workspace</b>

Points to Note:

* Start the tasks in "Data Source" and "Transform" columns.Please refer screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/edit/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion5.png?raw=true)

* Once started, the colour of the icons change to green as shown in screen below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/edit/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion3.png?raw=true)

* If the task is in stopped status then click on it to start again. 

Data source section will get network real-time traffic from traffic server and feed to Kafka cluster. The transform section allows to save the real-time data to HDFS. From HDFS, we can visualise the data using visualization tool like Tableau.

The generated output file is shown in section - "Data Source - file".</br>

### <b>Step 6 : Stop Tasks in workspace</b>

After viewing the network data, stop the tasks by clicking on <b>Stop</b> button in "Data Source" and "Transform" columns.
