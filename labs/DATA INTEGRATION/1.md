# DATA INTEGRATION

<b>Executed on</b>: Hadoop Big Data Platform


## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding.


We will be using DevNet Data Technology Learning Platform referred as "DTLP" during the course. In this lab, the network stream data is already pre-created. From DTLP platform, the user can access it directly. 

Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

### WHAT IS DATA INTEGRATION? - AN INTRODUCTION





### DTLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Technology Learning Platform (DTLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DTLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.

### <b>Step 4: Workspace Page</b>

On click of Start button, user will be navigated to a workspace page where all the components - IDE, Tools and Microservices required to execute the program are available. Please refer the screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/NETWORK%20DATA%20INGESTION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion2.png?raw=true)

### <b>Step 5 : Start Tasks in workspace</b>

Points to Note:

* Start the tasks in "Data Source" and "Transform" columns.Please refer screenshot below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/NETWORK%20DATA%20INGESTION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion5.png?raw=true)

* Once started, the colour of the icons change to green as shown in screen below:

![alt-tag](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/blob/master/labs/NETWORK%20DATA%20INGESTION/assets/images/NetworkDataIngestion3.png?raw=true)

* If the task is in stopped status then click on it to start again. 

Data source section will get network real-time traffic from traffic server and feed to Kafka cluster. The transform section allows to save the real-time data to HDFS. From HDFS, we can visualise the data using visualization tool like Tableau.

The generated output file is shown in section - "Data Source - file".</br>

PS: The window needs to be refreshed if the output file is not seen.
</br>


### <b>Step 6 : Stop Tasks in workspace</b>

After viewing the network data, stop the tasks by clicking on <b>Stop</b> button in "Data Source" and "Transform" columns.
