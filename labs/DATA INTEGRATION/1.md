# DATA INTEGRATION

<b>Executed on</b>: Hadoop Big Data Platform


## OVERVIEW

This learning lab can be used as a guide to get a high level understanding of Data Integration.</br> 

"Data Integration" refers to combining data from incompatible sources into meaningful and valuable information. 
Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### WHAT IS DATA INTEGRATION? - AN INTRODUCTION

"Data Integration" refers to combining data from incompatible sources into meaningful and valuable information.
Please refer the example shown below to get a high level understanding :

![alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/DATA%20INTEGRATION/assets/images/DataIntegration2.jpeg?raw=true)

We are using two different data sources here:</br>
1. Mysql which is a RDBMS data source.</br> 
2. Hive which is a Hadoop data source.</br>

Consider an organization with these two different data sources intends to develop an application or a report. A unified data store is required where data from both the above two data sources can be saved. There should be a unique key or an ID to identify and match the records in each of these data sources.
The unified view thus created helps users to get a better understanding of the data, faster decision making, Operational efficiency, Competitive advantage in the market etc.


### DTLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data Technology Learning Platform (DTLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DTLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.
