<h2><a id="APACHE_KAFKA__AN_INTRODUCTION_58"></a>APACHE KAFKA? - AN INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is designed to be fast, scalable, and durable. It has 3 key capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>It lets you publish and subscribe to streams of records. In this respect it is similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.</li>
<li>It lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.</li>
<li>It lets you process streams of records as they occur.</li>
</ol>
<p>It gets used for two broad classes of application:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications</li>
<li>Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="HADOOP__AN_INTRODUCTION_75"></a>HADOOP - AN INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributed storage and distributed processing of very large data sets on computer clusters built from commodity hardware. To understand Hadoop, there are two fundamental things about it -  How Hadoop stores files and how it processes data. The framework that is used in Hadoop to process data is called MapReduce.</p>
<p>All the modules in Hadoop are designed with a fundamental assumption that hardware failures are common and should be automatically handled by the framework. The core of Apache Hadoop consists of a storage part, known as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and a processing part called MapReduce. Hadoop splits files into large blocks and distributes them across nodes in a cluster.</p>
<p>Example : Imagine a file that is larger than the capacity of a computer then it would not be possible to store that file. Hadoop allows to store files bigger than what can be stored on one particular node or server. So it provides an ability to store very, very large files and also lets to store many, many files.</p>
