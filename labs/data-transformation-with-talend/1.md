# **Data Transformation from DLP using Talend**

# **Introduction about Transformation**
<b>Data transformation</b> is the process of converting data or information from one format to another, usually from the format of a source system into the required format of a new destination system. 

# **Lab Overview**
In our learning lab, we are trying to use Talend Open Source Big data tool to perform the transformation operation on CSV data file and save the data directly to Hadoop platform. Source data should be selected from DLP's Hadoop platform and the respective transformation would be applied from DLP's browser. In this learning lab, we will learn the transformation operation in below ways:  </br>

**Section A:** Download and Install Talend Open Studio for Big Data tool.</br>
**Section B:** Develop a Transformation Job using Talend Open Studio for Big Data Tool in user's local computer. </br>
**Section C:** Build Transformation Job using Talend Big Data Tool in user's local computer. </br>
**Section D:** Upload the transformation job in DLP platform.</br>
**Section E:** Execute transformation from DLP platform and visualise the data. </br>
