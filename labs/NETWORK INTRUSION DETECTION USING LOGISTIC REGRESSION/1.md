## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### APACHE ZEPPELIN - AN INTRODUCTION

Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. </br>

Zeppelin enables data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organising, executing, and sharing data code and visualising results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. It brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark. It supports Python and also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown. The various languages are supported via Zeppelin language interpreters. Zeppelin’s notebooks provides interactive snippet-at-time experience to data scientist.

###### Key Features:

1. Web based notebook style editor.

2. Built-in Apache Spark support.

###### Use Cases for Zeppelin :

1. Data Exploration and discovery

2. Data Visualization - Tables,graphs and charts

3. Interactive snippet-at-a-time experience

4. Collaboration and publishing

### MACHINE LEARNING - AN INTRODUCTION 

Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.It is evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence. It is a type of Artificial Intelligence that facilitates a computer’s ability to learn and teach itself to evolve as it becomes exposed to new and ever-changing data. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms is infeasible. 


###### Machine Learning Tasks

* Classification, inputs are divided into two or more classes

* Regression, the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.

* Clustering, a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand,       making this typically an unsupervised task.

* Density estimation finds the distribution of inputs in some space.

* Dimensionality reduction simplifies inputs by mapping them into a lower-dimensional space.


###### Examples of Machine Learning Applications 
 
* Network Intrusion

* Speech Recognition

* Image Recognition

* Recommender systems

* Autonomous driving etc.

### <b>Step 6 : Execute Python Code</b>

We are using code written in Python to build network intrusion detector using logistic regression. 

The code is as follows:


<b>Download the Dataset</b>

```json                          
%pyspark
import urllib
print 'Start downloading dataset'                                         
training_data_url = 'http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/
kddcup99/kddcup.data_10_percent.gz'  #Print 'Start downloading dataset'
urllib.urlretrieve(training_data_url, 'kddcup.data_10_percent.gz')        
print 'kddcup.data_10_percent.gz is downloaded'
testing_data_url = 'http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/
kddcup99/corrected.gz'
urllib.urlretrieve(testing_data_url, 'corrected.gz')
print 'corrected.gz is downloaded'
print 'Dataset Downloaded'
```
<b>Uncompress the Dataset</b>
```json  
%pyspark
import gzip
with gzip.open('kddcup.data_10_percent.gz', 'rb') as f:
training_raw_data = f.read()
with gzip.open('corrected.gz', 'rb') as f:
testing_raw_data = f.read()
```


<b>Data Preparation</b>
```json  
%pyspark

from pyspark.mllib.regression import LabeledPoint
#Split the training and testing dataset into data records
training_data = training_raw_data.split('\n')
testing_data = testing_raw_data.split('\n')

#In order to shorten the training time, select the first 10K data from training dataset 
for training, and Select the first 1K data from testing dataset for testing
training_data_rdd = sc.parallelize(training_data[:10000])
testing_data_rdd = sc.parallelize(testing_data[:1000])

#Set the label to 0 which are "normal" connection to 0, set the label to 1 which are not 
"normal" connection
training_data_rdd_labels = training_data_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(','))
.map(lambda line: line[:41]+[0] 
if line[41] == 'normal.' else line[:41]+[1] )
testing_data_rdd_mapped_flag = testing_data_rdd.map(lambda line: line.split(','))
.map(lambda line: line[:41]+[0] 
if line[41] == 'normal.' else line[:41]+[1] )

#Transform the records from [feature0, feature1, ..., featureN, label] to LabledPoint(label, 
[feature0, feature4, 
..., featureN]), skip the second,third and fourth feature
training_data_rdd_clean = training_data_rdd_labels.map(lambda line:LabeledPoint(line[41], 
[float(line[0])]+[float(i) 
for i in line[4:41]]))

#Transform the records from [feature0, feature1, ..., featureN, label] to [feature0, 
feature4, ..., featureN], 
skip the second, third and fourth feature
testing_data_rdd_clean = testing_data_rdd_mapped_flag.map(lambda line:[float(line[0])]+[float(i) for i 
in line[4:41]])

#Extract the labels of testing dataset
testing_data_rdd_labels = testing_data_rdd_mapped_flag.map(lambda line:line[41])
```
<b>Train the Logistic Regression Model</b>
```json  
%pyspark
from pyspark.mllib.classification import LogisticRegressionWithSGD, LogisticRegressionModel
lrm = LogisticRegressionWithSGD.train(training_data_rdd_clean, iterations=100)
```
<b>Evaluate the performance of Logistic Regression Model</b>
```json  
%pyspark
prediction = lrm.predict(testing_data_rdd_clean)
prediction_true_pair = zip(prediction.collect(), testing_data_rdd_labels.collect())
accuracy = sc.parallelize(prediction_true_pair).filter(lambda (p, t): p == t).count() / (float)(testing_data_rdd_labels.count())
print 'Classification Accuracy: %f' % accuracy
```

<b>Following functions are being done by the Python Code :</b>

1. Download the KDD 99 dataset for training data and testing data from internet

2. Uncompress KDD 99 dataset

3. Data Preparation

   Split the training and testing dataset into data records.
   
   In order to shorten the training time, select the first 10K data from training dataset for training, and 
   select the first 1K data from testing dataset for testing.
   
   Set the label to 0 which are "normal" connection to 0, set the label to 1 which are not "normal" connection.
   
   Remove 2,3,4 features in training data and testing data.
   
   Extract the labels of testing dataset.
   
4. Train the Logistic Regression Model
