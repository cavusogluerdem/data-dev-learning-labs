## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### APACHE ZEPPELIN - AN INTRODUCTION

Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. </br>

Zeppelin enables data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organising, executing, and sharing data code and visualising results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. It brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark. It supports Python and also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown. The various languages are supported via Zeppelin language interpreters. Zeppelin’s notebooks provides interactive snippet-at-time experience to data scientist.

###### Key Features:

1. Web based notebook style editor.

2. Built-in Apache Spark support.

###### Use Cases for Zeppelin :

1. Data Exploration and discovery

2. Data Visualization - Tables,graphs and charts

3. Interactive snippet-at-a-time experience

4. Collaboration and publishing

### DLP - AN INTRODUCTION ###

The DevNet Data technology Learning Platform (DLP) is an integrated data platform from CISCO that includes an easy-to-use UI, Docker-    based infrastructure, best-in-class open-source big-data components, and Cisco’s APIs and tools for data developers and data  scientists who want to develop, validate and provision their solutions before deploying or to explore, analyze, and    visualize their data. The DLP environment comes with an inbuilt cloud based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) built    on Hadoop.

### <b>Step 8 : Execute Python Code</b>

We are using code written in Python for ....... 

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
import numpy as np                                                     #Import numpy library
x = np.linspace( -np.pi, np.pi , 1000)                                 #Define a numpy array which should be eventually distributed along (-Pi, Pi).
y = np.cos(x)                                                          #Define an array y = cos(x)
print x,y                                                              #Print the cosine signal data
```
Following functions are being done by the Python Code :
