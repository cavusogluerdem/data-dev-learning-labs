## TERMINOLOGIES USED

### APACHE ZEPPELIN - AN INTRODUCTION

Zeppelin is a web-based notebook that enables interactive data analytics. You can make beautiful data-driven, interactive and collaborative documents with SQL, Scala and more. 

Zeppelin enables data engineers, data analysts and data scientists to be more productive by developing, organising, executing, and sharing data code and visualising results without referring to the command line or knowing the cluster details. It brings data exploration, visualization, sharing and collaboration features to Spark. It supports Python and also a growing list of programming languages such as Scala, Hive, SparkSQL, shell and markdown. The various languages are supported via Zeppelin language interpreters. Zeppelin’s notebooks provides interactive snippet-at-time experience to data scientist.

###### Key Features:

1. Web based notebook style editor.

2. Built-in Apache Spark support.

###### Use Cases for Zeppelin :

1. Data Exploration and discovery

2. Data Visualization - Tables,graphs and charts

3. Interactive snippet-at-a-time experience

4. Collaboration and publishing

### TENSORFLOW - AN INTRODUCTION 

TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the tensor. A tensor consists of a set of primitive values shaped into an array of any number of dimensions.The flexible architecture of TensorFlow allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. 
TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

### **Step 3 : Start Service in Workspace**

Points to Note:

* Start the Zeppelin service.Please refer screenshot below:

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/TENSORFLOW101/assets/images/Tensorflow3.jpeg?raw=true)

* Once started, the colour of the icon changes to green and launch button is enabled.

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/TENSORFLOW101/assets/images/Tensorflow4.jpeg?raw=true)

* If the task is in stopped status then click on it to start again. 

### **Step 4 : Launch Zeppelin**

Click on launch button and user will be navigated to Zeppelin home page.

Points to note:

(The pop-up may be blocked in browser configuration. Click on the red pop up blocker icon and select **Always allow pop-up from http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ** and click on **Done** button.)

### **Step 6 : Execute Python Code**

We are using code written in Python for data generation. 

The code is as follows:

```json
%python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# generate the mock data
x_data = np.float32(np.random.rand(2, 100))
y_data = np.dot([1.2, 3.0], x_data) + 0.1

# build a linear model
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
W = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([1, 2], -1.0, 1.0))
y = tf.matmul(W, x_data) + b

# minimize the variance
loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_data))
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)
train = optimizer.minimize(loss)

# initialize the variables
init = tf.global_variables_initializer()

# run the computational graph
sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(init)

# train the model and print the value for W and b
for step in range(0, 201):
    sess.run(train)
    if step % 20 == 0:
        curW, curb = sess.run([W, b])
        print("step: %d, W [%.10f, %.10f], b: %.10f" %(step, curW[0][0], curW[0][1], curb))
```
Following functions are being done by the Python Code :

1. Mock data generation.
   
2. Build a linear model.

3. Minimize the variance.

4. Initialize the variables.

5. Run the computational graph.

6. Train the model and print output values.


Execute the code by clicking on the icon highlighted as shown in screenshot below:. 

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/TENSORFLOW101/assets/images/Tensorflow7.jpeg?raw=true)

On successful execution of the code, the icon changes to "Finished" as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/TENSORFLOW101/assets/images/Tensorflow8.jpeg?raw=true)


### **Step 7 : View output**

In the previous step, we have created the linear model using Tensorflow, built and run the computational graph. The output shown after executing the python code is as shown below:


On successful execution of code, you can view the ouput as shown in screenshot below:

![Figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoDevNet/data-dev-learning-labs/master/labs/TENSORFLOW101/assets/images/Tensorflow9.jpeg?raw=true)

### **Step 8 : Stop Zeppelin service**

After viewing the images from DLP environment, we need to stop the Zeppelin service from DLP.
